Available CHASMplus models
--------------------------

CHASMplus can perform predictions either using a cancer type-specific model or in a "pan-cancer" manner by consider multiple cancer types together. Pan-cancer is a useful default if a matching cancer type is not available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We have made the following results available through OpenCRAVAT:
